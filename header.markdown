# Isaac's Snips

This is a place to store things that are too big for a twitter,
too small for a blog post, which I might want to share, and don't
want to lose, but others would be unlikely to follow regularly.

Also, it's an experiment in using github and a few shell scripts
as a blogging platform.

Enjoy.
