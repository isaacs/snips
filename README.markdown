# Isaac's Snips

This is a place to store things that are too big for a twitter,
too small for a blog post, which I might want to share, and don't
want to lose, but others would be unlikely to follow regularly.

Also, it's an experiment in using github and a few shell scripts
as a blogging platform.

Enjoy.

### Forgot [∞][2010-07-28/forgot/]

I totally forgot about this little blog.

How completely odd.  I guess it got its job done.  Or maybe I just started writing in my  [tumblr blog](http://blog.izs.me/) more often.

### Sharing [∞][2009-07-10/sharing/]

Sharing code is like sharing minds.  It is every bit as intimate as a relationship with a lover — moreso, perhaps.  

Unlike the things we share in other areas of our lives, there is no option for dishonesty, no artifice in which to hide.  By your comments, patterns, and bugs, your deepest and most intimate truths are exposed.  The very working of your mind is laid out in the editor's colored monotype for all to see, tracked in meticulous detail by your source control system, critiqued in cold honesty by the heartless computer.

It is possible to develop a deep love or profound disdain for someone, simply by reading their code.  You can get a sense of intellects far above or beneath your own.  Our minds laid bare in the pursuit of beauty and magic, yearning for appreciation, correction, growth.  I am convinced: there is no other way on earth to achieve this level of naked vulnerability.  The connection is frightening and life affirming, powerful and cruel, lovingly cold.

Perhaps it is right that programmers seem to give up a piece of their humanity in the pursuit of their craft.  What we get in return is worth the price.

### Topics [∞][2009-07-02/topics/]

I keep coming back to one singular topic.  
So I tell myself that I'm not going to write about that.  
But then, I don't write anything.

The purpose of this is to unblock, and it has no other purpose.  I'm writing for no audience, and only capturing the output because it may be interesting to see what unblocking uncovers.

So write about whatever you want.  Obsession is obsessed, but it's honest about it, at least, and that's the point.

### Responsibility [∞][2009-04-09/responsibility/]

Sometimes I just can't believe how much Yahoo trusts me.  I'm basically rewriting the core javascript for a major project, and the justification is that I said we had to.

### Discipline [∞][2009-03-29/discipline/]

Find the minimum valuable creation.  
Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.  
Minimalism is power.

### The Calm of Exertion [∞][2009-03-29/the-calm-of-exertion/]

Exerted and spent, and yet filled up and satisfied.  
Like a cat in the sun.  
It is work that brings this calm, strengthens the body and mind for another round.  
This is the reward of your effort.  
**Do not squander it!**

How often have I burnt myself out, and felt so overwhelmed, like there was never enough time, never enough of me to cover all the corners, spread and stretched as a sheet over too large a bed, butter across too much bread, thin and weary, cracking and torn, pulled to shreds.  So many times I've forgotten this lesson, forgotten to pick up my reward, and paid the price for it.

I've told myself that work is to blame.  I point the finger at the likely suspect, but the fact of the matter is that *I* was to blame, and didn't want to admit I'd caused my own pain.

There is plenty of time.  
Everyone will get by just fine.

Work hard, and rest deeply.  That is the Key.

### A New Structure [∞][2009-03-28/a-new-structure/]

I updated the structure of my snips.

As part of the commit of this change, I'm going to also have this snip.

Then, I'm going to post a commit message about the change, and about the fact that this snip is commenting on the change.

The metaness of this blog pleases me.

I *think* I *might* have just lost the whole archiving thing with `git rebase`.

Or not.  Let's see.

“If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”

### Rainbows [∞][2009-03-04/rainbows/]

We've seen 4 rainbows in the last few days at work.  Now I'm worried that:

* Rainbows don't impress me any more.
* If I don't see one today, I'll be depressed.

Rainbows have undone my happiness.

I'm smitten.  It's overwhelming.  Definitely more smit than I can whelm.
