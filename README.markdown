# Isaac's Snips

This is a place to store things that are too big for a twitter,
too small for a blog post, which I might want to share, and don't
want to lose, but others would be unlikely to follow regularly.

Also, it's an experiment in using github and a few shell scripts
as a blogging platform.

Enjoy.

### The Calm of Exertion [∞][2009-03-29/the-calm-of-exertion/]

Exerted and spent, and yet filled up and satisfied.  
Like a cat in the sun.  
It is work that brings this calm, strengthens the body and mind for another round.  
This is the reward of your effort.  
**Do not squander it!**

How often have I burnt myself out, and felt so overwhelmed, like there was never enough time, never enough of me to cover all the corners, spread and stretched as a sheet over too large a bed, butter across too much bread, thin and weary, cracking and torn, pulled to shreds.  So many times I've forgotten this lesson, forgotten to pick up my reward, and paid the price for it.

I've told myself that work is to blame.  I point the finger at the likely suspect, but the fact of the matter is that *I* was to blame, and didn't want to admit I'd caused my own pain.

There is plenty of time.  
Everyone will get by just fine.

Work hard, and rest deeply.  That is the Key.

### Discipline [∞][2009-03-29/discipline/]

Find the minimum valuable creation.  
Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.  
Minimalism is power.

### Uhoh? [∞][2009-03-28/uhoh/]

I *think* I *might* have just lost the whole archiving thing with `git rebase`.

Or not.  Let's see.

### A New Structure [∞][2009-03-28/a-new-structure/]

I updated the structure of my snips.

As part of the commit of this change, I'm going to also have this snip.

Then, I'm going to post a commit message about the change, and about the fact that this snip is commenting on the change.

The metaness of this blog pleases me.

Report down, not up.
Change direction, don't ask someone else to.

###Bruce Lee on Limits [∞][2009-03-23/bruce-lee-on-limits/]

“If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”

### Rainbows [∞][2009-03-04/rainbows/]

We've seen 4 rainbows in the last few days at work.  Now I'm worried that:

* Rainbows don't impress me any more.
* If I don't see one today, I'll be depressed.

Rainbows have undone my happiness.
