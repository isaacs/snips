# Isaac's Snips

This is a place to store things that are too big for a twitter,
too small for a blog post, which I might want to share, and don't
want to lose, but others would be unlikely to follow regularly.

Also, it's an experiment in using github and a few shell scripts
as a blogging platform.

Enjoy.

### Uhoh? [∞][2009-03-28/uhoh/]

I *think* I *might* have just lost the whole archiving thing with `git rebase`.

Or not.  Let's see.

### A New Structure [∞][2009-03-28/a-new-structure/]

I updated the structure of my snips.

As part of the commit of this change, I'm going to also have this snip.

Then, I'm going to post a commit message about the change, and about the fact that this snip is commenting on the change.

The metaness of this blog pleases me.

Report down, not up.
Change direction, don't ask someone else to.

“If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”

### Rainbows [∞][2009-03-04/rainbows/]

We've seen 4 rainbows in the last few days at work.  Now I'm worried that:

* Rainbows don't impress me any more.
* If I don't see one today, I'll be depressed.

Rainbows have undone my happiness.
