# Topics

I keep coming back to one singular topic.  
So I tell myself that I'm not going to write about that.  
But then, I don't write anything.

The purpose of this is to unblock, and it has no other purpose.  I'm writing for no audience, and only capturing the output because it may be interesting to see what unblocking uncovers.

So write about whatever you want.  Obsession is obsessed, but it's honest about it, at least, and that's the point.
